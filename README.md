# Bird's Eye View Vision System


## Introduction


The goal of this project is to develop a vision system for heavy vehicles.
There are many problems about operate heavy vehicles such as trucks, 
harvesters, and mining machines in a safe manner for the operator. 
Working with heavy vehicles,implies that the operator of the vehicle 
must be well aware of the surroundings. Otherwise, the vehicle as 
well as people and other things around it may pose a safety risk. 
The vehicles have blind spots that are not covered by the side view 
mirrors and in many the heavy vehicles, there is no way for the operator 
to see the rear of the vehicle to detect potential obstacles behind it. 
By implementing this camera system with integrated human detection, 
visibility limitations such as blind spots will be reduced and the operator’s 
awareness of the vehicle’s surroundings will be increased.

Accordingly, the following subtasks need to be addressed: 
+ Image distortion 
+ Image warping
+ Image stitching
+ Human detection
+ Resizing


## Proposed system

Below is a diagram which describe the implementation of the system.

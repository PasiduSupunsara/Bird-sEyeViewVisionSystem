# Bird's Eye View Vision System
_ _ _

The goal of this project is to develop a vision system for heavy vehicles. There are many problems about operate heavy vehicles such as trucks, harvesters, and mining machines in a safe manner for the operator. Working with heavy vehicles,implies that the operator of the vehicle must be well aware of the surroundings. 
Otherwise, the vehicle as well as people and other things around it may pose a safety risk. The vehicles have blind spots that are not covered by the side view mirrors and in many the heavy vehicles, there is no way for the operator to see the rear of the vehicle 
to detect potential obstacles behind it. By implementing this camera system with integrated human detection, visibility limitations such as blind spots will be reduced and the operator’s awareness of the vehicle’s surroundings will be increased.
